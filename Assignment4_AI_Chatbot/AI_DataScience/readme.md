# Use AI to do Data Science

### Assignment:
Do data science (ideally deep learning but simpler one is fine) using chatgpt code interpreter by picking a popular data set in kaggle website, upload and do various modules of data science - like my example . Export your chat transcript and submit it. Publish and Submit a medium article by selecting sections of the output 
Generate a nice report - in medium.com. Use savegpt extension to export your work to pdf, import and insert any images from chatgpt (screenshot extension).

# Facial Expression Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

Developed a Facial Expression Recognition (FER) System using the FER2013 dataset. The system will classify images of human faces into one of several emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc. Used the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology for performing this task. The following were the main steps to be noted in this process:

#### Data Exploration and Visualization: 
Understand the FER2013 dataset, including its structure, distribution of classes (emotions), and overall quality.
#### Data Preparation and Preprocessing: 
Perform data cleaning, normalization, augmentation, and splitting to prepare the dataset for model training.
#### Model Development: 
Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to recognize and classify facial expressions. Optionally, compare it to simpler baseline models.
#### Evaluation and Validation: 
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, confusion matrix) and validate its generalization capabilities.
#### Deployment Consideration: 
Consider how the model could be deployed in a real-world setting.
