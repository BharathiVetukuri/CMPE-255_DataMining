# Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) 

Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) to build a strong predictive model. It is widely used for both regression and classification problems due to its flexibility and high accuracy.

### Key Concepts in GBM Boosting:

Boosting is a technique where models are trained sequentially, with each new model trying to correct the errors of the previous ones. GBM focuses on the residual errors of the model at each step. 

# Gradient Descent:

The method optimizes a loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Log Loss) using gradient descent. At each iteration, the residuals (errors) are treated as the negative gradient of the loss function and a new tree is fitted to minimize these residuals.

# Weighted Updates:

Predictions are updated by combining the previous predictions with the weighted predictions of the new tree. A learning rate controls the contribution of each tree to the final model. 

# Steps in GBM 

### Initialize the Model:

Start with a simple model, often the mean of the target variable for regression or the log odds for classification. 

### Iterative Residual Learning:

**At each step:** Compute residuals (actual values minus predicted values). Fit a decision tree to these residuals (weak learner). Update the predictions by adding the weighted predictions of this tree. 

**Repeat:** Continue iterating until the specified number of trees (n_estimators) is reached or the error stops improving (early stopping). 

### Final Prediction:

Combine the predictions from all trees to generate the final output. 

### Advantages of GBM 

* High accuracy and flexibility.
* Can handle various loss functions (e.g., squared error, log loss).
* Works well with both small and large datasets.
*
* ### Comparison to Other Methods
*
* Unlike Random Forest, which trains trees independently and averages their results, GBM trains trees sequentially, with each tree focused on improving the previous one. Advanced variants like XGBoost and LightGBM are highly optimized versions of GBM with improved speed and scalability.
