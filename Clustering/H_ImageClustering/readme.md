ImageBind is a framework by Meta that enables creating embeddings for various modalities (audio, text, image, etc.) into a shared embedding space. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to work with audio embeddings using ImageBind and integrate them with LLMs.

What is ImageBind?
ImageBind enables embeddings for:

Audio
Text
Image
Depth
Thermal (infrared)
IMU (motion sensors)
It maps these modalities to a unified latent space, making it useful for cross-modal tasks.
