## Anomaly Detection Using PyOD**
PyOD (Python Outlier Detection) is an open-source Python library designed specifically for detecting outliers or anomalies in datasets. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for performing anomaly detection, making it a popular choice for researchers and practitioners. PyOD supports multivariate anomaly detection and can be integrated into machine learning pipelines.

### PyOD offers many algorithms categorized into:

**Linear Models:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Robust Covariance.
**Proximity Models:** k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Clustering-Based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF).
**Probabilistic Models:** Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Copula-Based Outlier Detection.
**Neural Networks:** Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders (VAE).
**Ensemble Methods:** Feature Bagging, Isolation Forest.
