Data engineering colab and apache beam or apache spark colab

Assignment:
a) Assignment 1 is to do a complete dataset EDA in colab (preferably using D3.js visualizations)
Pick a complex dataset from kaggle 
Please push to limits and demonstrate advanced d3.js visualizations 

b) Assignment 2 - Auto EDA with your favorite tool
Pick your favorite kaggle data set and favorite auto eda tool (like pandas profiler or sweetviz etc.,.) 
Do auto eda using one of the tools i discussed in the class which is your favorite. make it very appealing for viewers

c) Assignment 3 - Apache beam features - demonstrate apache beam in a colab including composite transform, pipeline io, triggers, windowing ,pardo and streaming

SOLUTION:

a) EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. It is a crucial step in the data analysis process, during which a data analyst or data scientist explores and visualizes data sets to understand their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. Here are the primary goals and steps involved in EDA:

Goals of EDA:
Discover Patterns: Identify patterns, trends, and relationships among data points.
Spot Anomalies: Detect outliers and anomalies that might skew the data or indicate data errors.
Frame Hypotheses: Formulate hypotheses and questions based on the visualization and understanding of the data.
Check Assumptions: Verify assumptions used in statistical models for further analysis or predictive modeling.
Prepare for Further Analysis: Prepare data for further processing, including cleaning and feature engineering, which are crucial for predictive modeling.

EDA is generally the first step in the data modeling process, right after initial data cleaning and preparation, and it guides how to proceed with predictive modeling or other advanced data analysis tasks. It is largely an open-ended process and can vary significantly from one analysis to another based on the data and the specific questions being asked.
