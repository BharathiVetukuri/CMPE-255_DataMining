# Assignment:

For each methodology (CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD )demonstrate a project which uses all stages of the the methodology - you can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks are fully complete and in depth and in detailed. You still need to verify the chatgpt code it generates manually, turn the project into proper colab. You need to write a medium article for each of the project. 

# Solution:

### SEMMA:

Using the SEMMA methodology, I successfully built a model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with a high degree of accuracy and recall. 

**Sample**: Selecting a representative sample from the dataset that is large enough to contain the important information, yet small enough to process efficiently.

**Explore**: Explore the data by searching for patterns, anomalies, and relationships among variables.

**Modify**: Modify the data to prepare it for modeling. This phase involves selecting, creating, and transforming variables.

**Model**: Apply various modeling techniques to the prepared data to predict outcomes or classify data.

**Assess**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and compare models to choose the best one for deployment.
