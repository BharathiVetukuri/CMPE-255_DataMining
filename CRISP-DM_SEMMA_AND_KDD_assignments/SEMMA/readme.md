# Assignment:

For each methodology (CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD )demonstrate a project which uses all stages of the the methodology - you can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks are fully complete and in depth and in detailed. You still need to verify the chatgpt code it generates manually, turn the project into proper colab. You need to write a medium article for each of the project. 

# Solution:

### SEMMA:

Using the SEMMA methodology, I successfully built a model capable of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions with a high degree of accuracy and recall. 

**Data Selection**: Identifying the relevant dataset for analysis.
