For each methodology (CRISP-DM SEMMA AND KDD )demonstrate a project which uses all stages of the the methodology - you can use detailed help from chatgpt/gpt4 for making sure each and every stage and all the subtasks are fully complete and in depth and in detailed. You still need to verify the chatgpt code it generates manually, turn the project into proper colab. You need to write a medium article for each of the project. 

# Solution:

By following the **CRISP-DM** methodology, I was able to systematically approach the Titanic dataset and build a robust machine learning model. Step by step process of CRISP DM:

**Business Understanding**: Clear objective to predict passenger survival.

**Data Understanding**: Explored patterns and relationships within the data.

**Data Preparation**: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling.

**Modeling**: Experimented with multiple models, choosing Random Forest for its strong performance.

**Evaluation**: Thoroughly assessed model performance, beyond just accuracy.

**Deployment**: Saved the model, preparing it for future use.
