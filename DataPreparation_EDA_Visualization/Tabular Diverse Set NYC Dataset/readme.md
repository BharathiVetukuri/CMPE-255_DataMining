# Data Preparation, EDA, Visualization

### Assignment: 

Your goal is to do EDA, visualization and data preparation and processing of popular kaggle datasets that need to be cleaned and build models
pick data sets one each

i) tabular diverse set of data types like nyc taxi or airbnb (use links i provided in class for inspiration - do not just copy paste the colab)

ii) timeseries - repeat the same tasks

For each

a) do detailed data preprocessing cleaning and all the steps - before that do detailed eda and visualization - Take chat gpt4 help if needed. you can use auto eda and auto ds together with your manual insights and auto ml 
b) do clustering and anomaly eliminations in the data sets. do data imputation etc.,. all steps in data preparation including feature processing and feature selection
c) build various ml models using auto ml including ensemble model - using autoviml

## Key Learnings from the Assignment:

# AutoViML - Automated Machine Learning Pipeline:

AutoViML stands for Automatic Variant Interpretable Machine Learning, which is a Python library designed to automate the process of building interpretable machine learning models. It is particularly user-friendly for both novice and expert data scientists, enabling rapid model development with minimal coding.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process that involves examining and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods.

# Sweetviz - Auto EDA Tool: 
An open-source Python library that generates beautiful, high-density visualizations to kickstart EDA with a detailed analysis report in an HTML format. It supports comparisons between datasets, which is particularly useful in supervised learning settings.

# Anomaly Detection: 
Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns or observations in data that do not conform to expected behavior, often referred to as outliers. These anomalies can indicate critical incidents, such as fraud, network breaches, or mechanical faults, making anomaly detection vital for early warning systems in various applications.

# Clustering: 
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning technique used to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (or cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It's widely used in data analysis to discover structures, group similar data, and identify distinct groups within datasets, which helps in data segmentation and detailed analysis.
